# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?** A: Version control allows us to access previous versions and backups in our code. This makes it easy to keep track of changes made to the code over time, and merge the changes and revisions we wish to keep.

* **What is a branch and why would you use one?** A: A branch is essentially a copy of the original (master) file. Creating multiple branches allows us to store changes individually and separately, so that we can later choose to merge specific and relevant changes.

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?** A: Committing a file refers to the process of creating a checkpoint or save point for the containing branch. A good commit message should be detailed, and specifically entail what changes have been made since the last version.

* **What is a merge conflict?** A: A merge conflict occurs when the system is given two branches or versions, but is instructed to merge them onto the same file region. Of course, the system cannot know which change to make-- thus, a merge conflict occurs and is fixed by avoiding these overlapping changes.

I'm gonna make a grocery run after submitting this.
