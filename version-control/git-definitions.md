# Git Definitions - Hello!!!!!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.


* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control software allows other team members to work on a project without overwriting or losing a timeline of changes. This is extremely useful to when building a project with several people due to the version control. Over the course of building a project, bugs may appear or added features will be implemented. It is quite useful to review past changes in order to solve future problems should they arise. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch gives you a personal copy of code to work on. It is useful because after you have implemented changes, you can ask your team memeber to do a code review to ensure implementation was done correctly without affecting the master code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is commiting your code after it has been staged. It is essential to write a good commit message to ensure all team members are aware of what changed in the code. 

* What is a merge conflict?

Git is telling you there is a conflict with the merge. You will need to address what had happened.
